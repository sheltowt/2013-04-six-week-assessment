Space complexity- the amount of memory required by the algorithm to run to completion.
Time complexity- the amount of time required for the algorithm to run to completion.  Usually measured in relationship to the algorithms run time, which is measured on the basis of the number of instructions in the algorithm.  Big-O notation simplifies this by focusing on the most important component of this, by reducing it to the largest power- ie.  linear, exponential, etc...
